I have already cloned it:
Let's setup the remaining parts

_**Assistant (default)**_

Great! Let me help you set up the remaining parts of the Magic Portfolio. First, let me check what's currently in your workspace and then we'll go through the setup steps.


---

Tool use: **list_dir**

<details>
            <summary>Listed directory undefined â€¢ **0** results</summary>
        
No results found
</details>

---

Perfect! I can see the Magic Portfolio is already cloned. Now let's set up the remaining parts. Let me create a todo list to track our progress and then start with the setup:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [-] Install project dependencies with npm install
- [ ] Review and configure once-ui.config.ts file
- [ ] Review and customize content.tsx file
- [ ] Start development server and verify setup
- [ ] Customize portfolio content (about, projects, blog posts)

---

Let's start by installing the dependencies:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
npm install
```

```
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio> npm install
```

---

Great! Now let's check the configuration files to understand what needs to be customized:


---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/resources/once-ui.config.ts

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: src/resources/content.tsx

---

Tool use: **read_file**

Read file: package.json

---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] Install project dependencies with npm install
- [ ] Review and configure once-ui.config.ts file
- [ ] Review and customize content.tsx file
- [ ] Start development server and verify setup

---

Perfect! Now let me update the todos and start the development server to test the setup:


---

Tool use: **todo_write**

## Todo List

- [x] Install project dependencies with npm install
- [-] Review and configure once-ui.config.ts file
- [ ] Review and customize content.tsx file
- [ ] Start development server and verify setup
- [ ] Customize portfolio content (about, projects, blog posts)

---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

Great! The development server is starting. Now let me review the configuration files and provide you with guidance on what needs to be customized:

## Configuration Review

### 1. **once-ui.config.ts** - Main Configuration File

**Key areas to customize:**

1. **Base URL** (Line 17): Currently set to `"https://demo.magic-portfolio.com"` - **You need to change this to your domain**
2. **Routes** (Lines 19-25): All routes are enabled by default
3. **Protected Routes** (Lines 35-37): Password protection is set up for one project
4. **Style Configuration** (Lines 75-86): Theme, colors, and design preferences
5. **Schema** (Lines 188-194): SEO metadata - **Update with your information**
6. **Social Links** (Lines 197-201): **Update with your social media links**

### 2. **content.tsx** - Content Configuration

**Key areas to customize:**

1. **Person Information** (Lines 4-13): Name, role, avatar, email, location
2. **Social Links** (Lines 21-44): **Update with your social media profiles**
3. **Home Page** (Lines 46-78): Headline, description, featured work
4. **About Page** (Lines 80-229): Work experience, studies, technical skills
5. **Gallery** (Lines 249-298): **Replace placeholder images with your photos**

## Next Steps

Let me check if there's an `.env.example` file to understand environment variables:


---

Tool use: **glob_file_search**

<details>
<summary>Searched codebase "*.env*" â€¢ **1** result in **1** directory</summary>

Directory: **c:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio** (1 file)

</details>

---

Let me check if the dev server is running properly:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000 | head -20
```

```
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio> curl -s http://localhost:3000 | head -20
head : The term 'head' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or 
operable program. Check the spelling of the name, or if a path was included, verify that the path 
is correct and try again.
At line:1 char:33
+ curl -s http://localhost:3000 | head -20
+                                 ~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ObjectNotFound: (head:String) [], CommandNotFoundException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : CommandNotFoundException

PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio>
```

---

Let me try a different approach to check if the server is running:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
netstat -an | findstr :3000
```

```

PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio> netstat -an | findstr :3000
  TCP    0.0.0.0:3000           0.0.0.0:0              LISTENING

  TCP    [::1]:11372            [::1]:3000             CLOSE_WAIT
  TCP    [::1]:11781            [::1]:3000             ESTABLISHED
  TCP    [::1]:12392            [::1]:3000             CLOSE_WAIT

_**User (2025-10-22 11:29Z)**_

Could we rename the parent folder from madic-portfolio to portfolio?

---

_**Assistant (default)**_

I can see from the terminal output that the development server is actually running on port 3001 (not 3000 as I mentioned earlier) because port 3000 was already in use. 

Let me help you rename the parent folder from `magic-portfolio` to `portfolio`. First, let me stop the development server and then rename the folder:


---

Tool use: **run_terminal_cmd**

```bash
taskkill /F /PID 15708
```

```
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio> taskkill /F /PID 15708
SUCCESS: The process with PID 15708 has been terminated.
PS C:\Users\USER\Desktop\Elias\magic-portfolio>
```
